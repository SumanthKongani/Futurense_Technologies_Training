# Transaction: ACID

A - Atomicity	-> It means either all the operations (insert, update, delete) inside a transaction take place or none
C - Consistency	-> It means, whatever happens in the middle of the transaction, this acid property will never leave your database in a half-completed state. 
I - Isolation	-> Every transaction is individual, and One transaction canâ€™t access the result of other transactions until the transaction completed
D - Durability	-> Even if there is a system failure, or any abnormal changes also, this property will safeguard the committed data.
